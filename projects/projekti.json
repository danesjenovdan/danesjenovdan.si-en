To address this we created an online campaign in which we redesigned their ads by exposing companies as direct patrons of hatred, racism, homophobia, xenophobia, and chauvinism. Individual ads can be shared independently on social networks - and indeed some have become viral hits. The campaign helped to bring this topic to the highest levels and we saw the Prime Minister urge companies to think about where they advertise, and we were urged - in the form of funny PR maneuvers - by companies that we should be respectful of their reputation, which they apparently suddenly started to care about.

The proposed Article 11 jeopardized the right to link: lobbyists of large publishers wanted to restrict the free flow of information and charge websites for displaying links to their content. Article 13 was problematic because it proposed the introduction of automatic content filters, which would allow for censorship even in the fair use of copyrighted works (eg. memes, parodies, quotations etc.). Articles 3 and 4, dealing with permitted exceptions for data mining and education, required further elaborations and clearer definitions.<br>With the campaign, together with similar activist actions throughout Europe, we achieved a temporary success: the reform was not adopted, and the European Parliament will discuss it again in autumn.",

Modern history is full of attempts to relativize the definitions of good and bad, friend and enemy, hero and traitor, partisans and Slovene home guard. The fact that the war was followed by wrongful acts of the winning side does not mean that there was no collaboration with the Nazi regime or that such collaboration is morally equivalent to cooperation with the Allies. Post-war crimes should be investigated and punished and all family members should be given the opportunity to bury their dead, but a monument that equates members of the home guard with partisans can only be tagged with graffiti.",

Slovenia, as a signatory to the Paris Agreement, committed to a complete decarbonisation of the energy and industrial sectors by 2050, which means that instead of investing in coal-fired power plants we should accept their inevitable end - and do everything in our power to reach it as soon as possible.

The office of President indeed presupposes promulgating laws regardless of whether the person holding the position agrees with them or not, but it is also possible to think the presidency beyond political pragmatism and established habits. If the president refused to promulgate the Aliens Act, he would indeed risk dismissal in the Parliament, but would gain much in terms of human integrity and symbolic authority. The President's Office rejected such an act of rebellion as impossible, but this judgment applies only within the assumption that Pahor should remain in function no matter what, continuing his non-conceptual behaviour to provide support for the next nomination.

        "On March 5th 2013 we organised a workshop on attempts at privatising water resources in search of more democratic ways of managing the commons. The topic for our first participatory session experts (Nikolai Jeffs, Maja Simoneti, Urša Šebenik in Žiga Vodovnik), those interested and passers-by organised by Today is a new day came out of our web platform.",

        "Predlogi (proposals) is a platform for constructive, safe and inclusive debate, which was conceived by the originally informal community Today is a new day, which today operates within the Institute. We started conceiving the tool at the beginning of nationwide protests in November 2012, the first very rudimentary version was published during the protests on the 7th of December. The platform has since then substantially filled with content, functionally developed and updated, and is currently archived. We plan to use it again in the future for the purposes of participatory decision-making with local communities.",

Although the event lasted for only 30 seconds, it effectively showed two possible visions for the future of Slovenian society: one is yellow, the other a rainbow.",

We are especially proud of our use of gamification design patterns, that garnered worldwide attention the following year. The police still chase after the peaceful smokers, but we are confident one day we'll be done with that as well.",
